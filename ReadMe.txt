This is a collection of some re-writes of Cura's included post processors, some of my own ideas, and some that were requested by other people.
A couple of these have been included in Cura.  Others like "Add Cura Settings" were deemed to be too hard to maintain and so they won't be included.

You can download them and put them in the "scripts" sub-folder in your "Configuration Folder".  They will be available with the other post processors under "Extensions".

The "AAA_Post Processor ReadMe_GV.pdf" and "AAA_PostProcessReadMe_GV.py" file both need to be added.  The "py" file will show up in the list of post processors and will open the PDF file.  It contains some descriptions and instructions for these post processors as well as some help for Cura's native post processors.
